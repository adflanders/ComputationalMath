# SAXPY operation with random vectors and scalars

* The equation of y = mx + b where y, x and b are all vectors, and m is a scalar. x and b are randomly generated along with m.  

## Input

- If NOT using randomly generated vectors and scalars, then those said vectors and scalars would be required for input.  


## Output

- y at every iteration depending on the size of the vectors
