# Tasks predicated off of the list given [here](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/tasksheets/html/tasksheet_04.html)

* Notes for Dr. Koebbe:

**Task 1)**

I would say that using just newtons method or secant method would be better than using a hybrid method FOR a function like sin(x) or cos(x) since
we know that the multiple roots won't be that far away from eachother. I would apply a hybrid method to a function where the roots could
be far apart, but not such with a trig function. Secondly, based on my own results, newtons method worked far better in finding many more roots
than bisection did.

**Task 2)**
