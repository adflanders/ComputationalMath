# Tasks predicated off of the list given [here](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/tasksheets/html/tasksheet_01.html)

* Notes for Dr. Koebbe: The shared library is still a work in progress and I am trying to resolve the problems. That said, all the cpp files that hold the actual functions are located [here](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/src) if you wish to grade/look at them for confirmation.
* More Notes: I know in class you asked us to simply copy and past our code onto here for you to look at, but I was having trouble doing that due to syntax from c++ messing with markdown. In the mean time any task that displays code is hyperlinked to the codes file through the tasks number. If you want me to try and just do copy paste I will, or else I can come talk to you about the issues I am having with it. I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

Task 1) Emailed you my [github page](https://adflanders.github.io/).

Task 2) Emailed you regarding my math4610 repo and that it is indeed private and sent you an invite.

Task 3) Emailed you letting you know that I will be using cygwin.

[Task 4)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/whatLang.cpp) Show which coding language we plan on using via a program.

Task 5) Emailed you my math4610 repo's table of contents for homework.

[Task 6)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/centDer.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing a derivative to show how machince precision collapses as h -> (infinity). 

[Task 7)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/src) Created the abs and rel error functions and put them in my src folder

[Task 8)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/srcLibrary) Created my shared library and also implemented my smaceps and dmaceps functions in it. (Still working on/figuring out shared library for c++).

[Task 9)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/piExp.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing the derivative of f(x)=e^(x) and then evaluate f'(x) at f'(pi). Use the absolute and relative error routines from [adamslib.a](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/srcLibrary/adamslib.a).

[Task 10)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/abs&rel.txt) Write about our findings online regarding what absolute and relavtive error is along with how they are used.
