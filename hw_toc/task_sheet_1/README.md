# Tasks predicated off of the list given [here](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/tasksheets/html/tasksheet_01.html)

* Notes for Dr. Koebbe: The shared library is still a work in progress and I am trying to resolve the problems. That said, all the cpp files that hold the actual functions are located [here](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/src) if you wish to grade/look at them for confirmation.

[Task 4)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/whatLang.cpp) Show which coding language we plan on using via a program.

[Task 6)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/centDer.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing a derivative to show how machince precision collapses as h -> (infinity). 

[Task 7-8)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/srcLibrary) Put the 4 machine precision and error programs in a src folder and create a dynamic library.

[Task 9)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/piExp.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing the derivative of f(x)=e^(x) and then evaluate f'(x) at f'(pi). Use the absolute and relative error routines from [adamslib.a](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/srcLibrary/adamslib.a).

[Task 10)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/abs&rel.txt) Write about our findings online regarding what absolute and relavtive error is along with how they are used.

Tasks not listed here were simply tasks based off of sending emails and getting things such as getting this repository set up.
