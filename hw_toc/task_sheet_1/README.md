# Tasks predicated off of the list given [here](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610/tasksheets/html/tasksheet_01.html)

* Notes for Dr. Koebbe: The shared library is still a work in progress and I am trying to resolve the problems. That said, all the cpp files that hold the actual functions are located [here](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/src) if you wish to grade/look at them for confirmation.

Task 1) Emailed you my [github page](https://adflanders.github.io/).

Task 2) Emailed you regarding my math4610 repo and that it is indeed private and sent you an invite.

Task 3) Emailed you letting you know that I will be using cygwin.

[Task 4)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/whatLang.cpp) Show which coding language we plan on using via a program.

Task 5) Emailed you my math4610 repo's table of contents for homework.

[Task 6)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/centDer.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing a derivative to show how machince precision collapses as h -> (infinity). 

[Task 7)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/src) Created the abs and rel error functions and put them in my src folder

[Task 8)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/srcLibrary) Created my shared library and also implemented my smaceps and dmaceps functions in it. (Still working on/figuring out shared library for c++).

[Task 9)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/piExp.cpp) Use the central difference form for computing the derivative of f(x)=e^(x) and then evaluate f'(x) at f'(pi). Use the absolute and relative error routines from [adamslib.a](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/srcLibrary/adamslib.a).

[Task 10)](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/blob/master/hw_toc/task_sheet_1/abs&rel.txt) Write about our findings online regarding what absolute and relavtive error is along with how they are used.
