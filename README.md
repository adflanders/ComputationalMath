# Adam's Repository for Math 4610

Repo for Adam Flanders, enrolled in Math 4610 - Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics

## Software Manual

The [software manual](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/Software-Manual) is where you will be able to refer to all the code and programs through this repo, such as basic routines and methods used to solve mathematical problems computationaly.


## Homework - Task sheets and links

Contains links to directories containing a given task sheets objectives and files. The shared library will not be redundantly linked here. If needed, the "README" in each task sheet will specify which files require it, to which you can refer back to and download from the basic routines section in the software manual.

* Task Sheet table of contents may be found [here](https://github.com/adflanders/math4610/tree/master/hw_toc).
